    "- **ParallelSequentialIteratior**: This class takes a dataset and creates batches(with batch size N) from it. In the first \\_\\_next()\\_\\_ step it will give the first words of N sequences as input and as target value the next word in the sequence. In the next \\_\\_next\\_\\_() call it will return the 2nd word of N sequences as input and the third word for as target etc. Running multiple sequences at the same time allows for efficient matrix multiplication(especially useful for GPU acceleration) furthermore the gradients for all sequences can be summed and applied immediately(allowing for statistic gradient descent). \n",
    "- **BPTTUpdater**: To obtain the weight gradients for our neural network we make use of back propagation trough time algorithm. It unfolds a neural network into a normal feedforward network where each layer represents one timestep, and then sums the gradients for each connection. The gradients are only saved for a fixed number of steps (\"truncated\"). \n",

It  assumes to obtain the softmax classification error as is used by default by the [chainer L.Classifier link](http://docs.chainer.org/en/stable/_modules/chainer/links/model/classifier.html?highlight=Classifier)"

For this purpose we select the 10 most frequent words occuring in both languages, map the two languages to a 2d space using pca and plot them.
